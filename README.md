🛰️ Project Title

SeCure BEAM – Two-Way Laser-Based Text Communication System

💡 Project Overview

SeCure BEAM is a laser-based optical communication system that transmits text data using a light beam instead of radio waves or cables.
It’s a simple, low-cost prototype that shows how data can be sent securely over a line-of-sight optical link using basic semiconductor components.

The system uses:

a laser diode to send data as light pulses (1s and 0s), and

an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) to receive those pulses by sensing brightness changes.

Text typed on one Arduino’s serial monitor is converted into binary form, transmitted through the laser beam, and then decoded and displayed on the receiving Arduino’s serial monitor and LCD screen.

This version supports two-way communication, meaning either side can send or receive messages by switching modes through simple commands.
